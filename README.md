# Ritger-Corynactis-urchin-deterrence

*Corynactis californica as a deterrent to purple urchin foraging*

I am studying how intraspecific variation might play a role in the ability of the strawberry anemone (*Corynactis californica*) to act as a deterrent to urchin foraging.

# Code

file name | analysis overview | description 
---|---|-----------
kelp consumption analysis.R | Analyze kelp consumption | This works through data organization and analysis of urchin foraging behavior minus video analysis; analysis with mixed model ANOVA.
video analysis.R | Analyze trial videos | This works through data organization and analysis of urchin foraging behavior using videos shot by GoPro Hero 3+; each tile containing Corynactis was subject to one trial for video analysis.
power test.R | Power test | This uses data from Xavius Boone's 2019 OGC REU experiment (Github link: [@Boone-2019-urchin-anemone-fed-unfed](https://github.com/stier-lab/Boone-2019-urchin-anemone-fed-unfed)) to run a power test for minimum sample sizes needed to find significance in the data.
