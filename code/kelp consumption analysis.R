#treatment doesn't have an effect on area kelp consumed, might be an effect on yes/no consumption (though it looks weird, lots of overlap)
#tile number doesn't have any strong correlations
#yes/no Corynactis doesn't have an effect on area kelp consumed, yes/no consumption

## Aight. Let's look at the effect of color on whether or not urchins ate, "averaged" amongst tiles
# because not every tile was actually used twice (thanks to urchins not moving, etc), get the total counts each tile was used and add it as a column to data frame
data <- data[order(data$Cory_numb),] #sort whole data frame by tile number
df <- data # separate this organization from the whole data frame in case you mess something up
df <- df[order(df$Cory_numb),] #sort subsetted data frame by tile number
df$Cory_numb[df$Cory_numb==0] <- c(-1:-15) #change all controls to unique negative numbers to get count values
new <- count(df, Cory_numb) #count values for each tile number
duptimes <- c(new$n) #how many replicates I want of each row
indx <- rep(1:nrow(new), duptimes) # Create an index of the rows I want with duplications
dupdf <- new[indx,] # Use that index to generate new data frame
dupdf$Cory_numb[1:15] <-0 #change control values back to tile number "0"
dupdf$n[1:15] <- 15 #change duplications for control tiles to 15
data$count_per_tile <- dupdf$n #add the counts to the whole data frame

#now put it all together 
#library(dplyr)
data_avg <- data %>%
  group_by(Cory_numb) %>%                                     # group tile numbers together

#check your work
table(data_avg$Treatment,data_avg$failure)
table(data$Cory_numb, data$consumption_binary) # nice work!

#now to create the model
library(lme4)
#treating the data as bernoulli...but m1 here doesn't address non-independence of each trial
#data$consumption_yn <- ifelse(data$consumption_binary>0, "Yes", "No")
#data_bern <- data[c("Treatment", "Cory_numb", "consumption_binary", "consumption_yn")]
#m1 <- glm(consumption_binary ~ Treatment + Cory_numb, family = binomial, data = data_bern)
#m2 <- glm(consumption_binary ~ Treatment, family = binomial, data = data_bern)

#this is actually realistically treating the data as bernoulli, sucesses given failures amongst treatments and tiles
m1 <- glm(cbind(success, count_per_tile-success) ~ Treatment, family = binomial , data = data_avg)
summary(m1) 
#red color morphs are significantly different from control tiles (p = 0.0226), red color morphs are more likely to result in urchin failures

#data$Cory_numb_f <- as.factor(data$Cory_numb)
#m <- glmer(consumption_binary ~ Treatment + (1 | Cory_numb_f), data = data, family = binomial)

# Tiered Analysis: Among the urchins that ate, how does Corynactis matter in how much they ate?

###??? should I do something like lm(area consumed) compared to binary analysis above using glm(proportion data)?

# create new data frame for instances where urchins ate something (not nothing)
data_consumption <- subset(data, data$area_corrected>0)

#visualize correlations among variables
ggpairs(data_consumption[,c("Treatment", "Cory_numb", "corynactis_binary", "urchin_avg_g", "area_corrected")])
#urchin size, corynactis presence/absence, nor treatment determined how much kelp was consumed

# Univariate analysis for Y
hist(data_consumption$area_corrected, main="") #looks fine
boxplot(data_consumption$area_corrected) #2 outliers
qqnorm(data_consumption$area_corrected)
qqline(data_consumption$area_corrected) #could be better, but let's look at the model/residuals

## OPTIONAL...
#remove outliers
outliers <- boxplot(data_consumption$area_corrected)$out
data_consumption <- data_consumption[-which(data_consumption$area_corrected %in% outliers),]

# "fancy" plot kelp consumption with and without Corynactis
ggplot(data_consumption,aes(x=corynactis_binary,y=area_corrected))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter()+
  xlab("Treatment")+
  ylab("kelp area consumed, when consumed")+
  theme_bw()
#ggsave("figures/present_absent.pdf",a,width=5,height=5)

# super quick linear regression model
m2 <- lm(area_corrected ~ Treatment, data=data_consumption)

# add tile as a random effect
library(lmerTest)
m3 <- lmer(area_corrected ~ Treatment + (1|Cory_numb), data = data_consumption)

data_consumption$residuals <- residuals(m2)

library(psycho)
results <- analyze(m3, CI = 95)
summary(results) %>%

print(results)
#as suspected, there was no effect of treatment on amount of kelp consumed by urchins, when any kelp was consumed

# from bart
#library(betareg)
#summary(betareg(percent_corrected~Treatment, data=data_consumption)) #but I think I can just do a simple mixed model regression looking at area consumed, no??

####################################################
## SO, in conclusion:
## Red color morph increases probability urchin will fail to eat any kelp
## But there was NO EFFECT of treatment on amount of kelp consumed, when urchins did consume kelp
