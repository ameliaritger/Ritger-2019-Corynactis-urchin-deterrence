datay <- subset(data, `Kelp visibly consumed?`=="yes")
sort(datan$percent_consumed) #If any percent consumption is less than 0.04, we assume there was no consumption (aka 'remove' ImageJ analysis error)...minus the one piece of kelp that definitely had a tiny bit of urchin chewing it

# Average urchin body weight before and after trials

# To see if balcony versus wet lab location had an effect

# To keep all control values rather than average them, assign each control trial a unique number
