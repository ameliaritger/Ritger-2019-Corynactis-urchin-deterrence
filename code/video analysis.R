#look for correlations among variables

#look at Treatment with everything
#look at corynactis_binary with everything
#come back to this when making final conclusions, because lots of the Ys are highly correlated with eachother (obviously) so you want to avoid being  repetitive by commenting on different relationships with correlated variables
# % time with kelp is - corr with % time with alone (-.98) and both are corr with # deterrence (0.58, -0.57)
# number of contacts with tile is + corr with number deterrence events (0.81) and number crosses (0.38)
#interesting things to look at separately - # deterrence, # crosses, time to cross tile
