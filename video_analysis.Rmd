#look at treatment with everything
#look at corynactis_binary with everything
#come back to this when making final conclusions, because lots of the Ys are highly correlated with eachother (obviously) so you want to avoid being  repetitive by commenting on different relationships with correlated variables
# % time with kelp is - corr with % time with alone (-.98) and both are corr with # deterrence (0.58, -0.57)
# number of contacts with tile is + corr with number deterrence events (0.81) and number crosses (0.38)
#interesting things to look at separately - # deterrence, # crosses, time to cross tile
```

# How does presence of Corynactis affect "outcome" (see data frame)?
```{r}

fisher.test(t1) #fisher's exact test is useful when sample sizes are particularly small... p=0.0505
cs <- chisq.test(X, outcome) #p = 0.0393, yes/no Corynactis and outcome are dependent
# Urchins always crossed tile when it didn't have Corynactis significantly more than expected
```

# How does treatment type affect "outcome" (see data frame)?

#urchin was never detered from tile when Corynactis was absent, urchins were likely to be deterred when Corynactis present
```

t1 = t1[-1,] # because "Control" is driving the whole relationship
prop.test(t1, correct=TRUE) #p=0.8174
